# Error handling made precise

Because error handling belongs in the types.

## Installation

This project compiles to Scala 3.x and Scala 2.13.

Add it as an sbt dependency:
```scala
libraryDependencies += "info.umazalakain" %% "errata" % version
```

## Rationale

There is a [video presentation](https://youtu.be/oMG0yA9poLM?feature=shared&t=60) with this ideas, and also some [slides](docs/lsug-may-2024.pdf) to go with it.

The [approach to error handling taken by cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses/applicativemonaderror.html) suffers from several shortcomings.
Assume a method with signature `def method[F[_]: ApplicativeError[*, AppError], A](fa: F[A]): F[A]`.
It might be the case that `method` raises errors, hence why `ApplicativeError[F, AppError]` is necessary.
Or, it might not raise any errors, and rather handle them.
From the signature alone, we cannot deduce whether `method` raises errors, handles them, or does both.

By itself, error handling is imprecise too.
`ApplicativeError.attempt` transforms an `F[A]` into an `F[Either[E, A]]`, which has two error channels: `Either[E, *]` where errors are reported as `Left`; and `F` itself, still capable of raising errors.
_The fact that errors were handled is not reflected in the effect types._

Moreover, managing multiple error types is highly impractical:
using multiple implicits `ApplicativeError[F, E1]` and `ApplicativeError[F, E2]` results in ambiguous implicit resolution, since both extend `Applicative[F]`.
Indeed, one can extend `E1` and `E2` with `Throwable` and substitute both `ApplicativeError[F, E1]` and `ApplicativeError[F, E2]` with `ApplicativeThrow[F]` (`ApplicativeError[F, Throwable]`).
In this case, we lose information about the types of errors we raise, and must now deal with all errors of type `Throwable`.

> :warning: **As a consequence of all of the above, services based on error handling à la cats are brittle and unnecessarily prone to runtime crashes:
> it becomes impossible to track which modules raise what errors, and the compiler cannot ensure that errors are appropriately dealt with**.

Cats-mtl takes a step in the right direction by defining types [`Raise[F[_], E]`](https://typelevel.org/cats-mtl/mtl-classes/raise.html) and [`Handle[F[_], E]`](https://typelevel.org/cats-mtl/mtl-classes/handle.html).
However, we notice that `Handle[F, E]` 1) extends `Raise[F, E]` and 2) doesn't bind an output effect — like errata's `HandleTo[F, G, E]` does.
As a consequence, we cannot limit a function to error handling _only_ (it will be able to raise errors too), and we cannot use effect types to keep track of error handling (the output effect type will be the same).
Errata provides solutions to both these shortcomings.

## Solution

This project exposes the error handling capabilities provided by [ToFu](https://github.com/tofu-tf/tofu/).
As such, their code is at times shared verbatim.

We differentiate between programs that _raise_ errors, and programs that _handle_ them.

### Raising errors

The type `Raise[F, E]` tells us that we know how to raise errors of type `E` inside an effect `F[_]`.
```scala
trait Raise[F[_], E] {
  def raise[A](err: E): F[A]
}
```

### Handling errors

The type `HandleTo[F, G, E]` tells us that we know how to transform an effect `F[_]` into an effect `G[_]` by handling all errors of type `E`.
```scala
trait HandleTo[F[_], G[_], E] {
  def handleWith[A](fa: F[A])(f: E => G[A]): G[A]
}
```
For any type `A`, we are able to transform _all_ values of type `F[A]` into values of type `G[A]` _merely_ by handling the error cases with `E => G[A]`.
That is, _all_ errors of type `E` are dealt with by the time we reach `G`.

### Bundles

We provide further convenience methods and bundles of types.
You may check them out in more detail [here](errata/src/main/scala/errata/types.scala).

- `Handle[F[_], E]`: equivalent to `HandleTo[F, F, E]`, plus convenience methods.
- `ErrorsTo[F[_], G[_], E]`: equivalent to `Raise[F, E]` plus `HandleTo[F, G, E]` --- often what you want.
- `Errors[F[_], E]`: equivalent to `ErrorsTo[F, F, E]` plus convenience methods.
- `TransformTo[F[_], G[_], E1, E2]`: equivalent to `HandleTo[F, G, E1]` plus `Raise[G, E2]`, plus convenience methods.

We also define type aliases `HandleToThrow`, `HandleThrow`, `ErrorsToThrow`, and `ErrorsThrow`: they instantiate the `E` error parameter of their respective types to `Throwable`.

### Syntax

We provide convenience syntax for error types `E` and effect types `F[A]`.
It can be brought into scope with:
```scala
import errata.syntax.all.*
```
Sometimes this syntax can conflict with the syntax of cats or other libraries.
As a workaround, we provide a namespaced version, where you use `.withErrata` to bring into scope errata's syntax.
Import it with:
```scala
import errata.syntax.namespaced.*
```

### Example instances

As an example, we derive instances `Raise` and `HandleTo` for the concrete type `Either[E, _]`.
We provide these instances by combining them into one single instance `ErrorsTo[Either[E, _], Id, E]`.
This shows that:
- for any value type `A` we can use `Either[E, A]` to represent errors; and that
- for any value type `A` we can transform values of type `Either[E, A]` into values of type `Id[A]` (aka `A`) by handling errors of type `E`.

```scala
final implicit def eitherInstance[E]: ErrorsTo[Either[E, _], Id, E] =
  new ErrorsTo[Either[E, _], Id, E] {
    override def raise[A](err: E): Either[E, A] =
      Left(err)
    override def handleWith[A](fa: Either[E, A])(f: E => Id[A]): Id[A] =
      fa.fold(f, identity)
  }
```

## Interoperability with cats

Full interoperability with cats and its `ApplicativeError` and `ApplicativeThrow` is provided in `errata.instances.*`.
Check out [the examples](examples/src/main/scala/).

To derive an `Errors[F, E]` instance given an `cats.Applicative[F]`:
```scala
import errata.instances.*
implicit val errorsFE: Errors[F, E] = errorsThrowable(classTag[E])
```

## Algebraic laws and testing

All instances must satisfy certain [algebraic laws](/errata/src/main/scala/errata/laws/) to be considered well behaved.

We use [discipline](https://github.com/typelevel/discipline) to perform quickcheck-style checking of these laws.
The laws are grouped into [discipline bundles](/errata/src/test/scala/errata/discipline/) and [tested against concrete types](/errata/src/test/scala/errata/tests/).
Given a custom concrete type and its corresponding error raising/handling instances, you can verify they are lawful by running them on the existing discipline bundles.

To execute the tests simply run `sbt test`.

## Example

import cats.effect.{ExitCode, IO, IOApp}
import cats.effect.std.Console
import cats.syntax.all.*
import cats.{Applicative, MonadThrow}
import errata.*
import errata.syntax.all.*
import errata.instances.*
